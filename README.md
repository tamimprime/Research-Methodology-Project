A Review on The Use of Artificial Intelligence in  Agricultural Field 
Agricultural field plays an important role in our society from the very beginning of mankind. Not only on 
the economy but also the very existence of mankind depends on the prosperity of the agricultural field. Not 
to mention the rapid increase of the population all over the world which is also making a great impact on 
the cultivational lands because of the increase of urbanization. The cultivational lands are decreasing more 
and more day by day. Farmers are also shifting to other professions in order to income more money. At 
this point, it is high time to consider the facts and build a new way in which growing more paddy will be 
able to possible in limited lands by using artificial intelligence as an ally. The use of artificial intelligence 
is increasing in the agricultural field day by day as we speak but it has not been fully operational in many 
countries because of its high costing. Many farmers who still do farming in the old traditional ways, do not 
know the proper ways to install the applications of the synthetic intelligence techniques. Many reaches have 
been done in order to increase the applications of the artificial intelligence in the agricultural fields. But 
the real-life implementation of the applications of techniques like using drones or robots for weeding, 
cultivating, watering and collecting the paddy from the fields have not fully accomplished in all over the 
world. This paper has been written as a review over all of the researches done on use of artificial 
intelligence in agriculture. Finding out the gap between the theoretical researches and the implementations 
of those researches in real and the biggest limitations of this technology are the main goals of this review 
paper.
